		<p>The Lester Test is a test designed to measure anxiety about the subject of death and opinions related to death. It is not meant to be a diagnostic tool but can prove insightful for average people.</p>

        <div id="Quiz_Preface"><p>The test works as follows:</p></div>
		<div id="Quiz_Instructions"><ul>
		  <li>The following statements will present opinions of death. Check whether you agree (A) or disagree (D) with that statement.</li>
		  <li>Each statement has a value. The values of the statements you agreed with will be added together and divided by the number of statements you agreed with.</li>
		  <li>The result of the math will rest between the values of two statements. Those two statements will best represent your views on death. For example, if statement 5 has a value of 5.0, and statement 6 has a value of 5.51, and you scored 5.43, then statements 5 and 6 are best representative of your views.</li>
		</ul></div>
